# reiora

my first Love2D game - practicing lua/love and hopefully useful for any other beginner :) <br />
there`s no objective, just testing player movement and collision<br />

WASD - player control

!!! - since I don`t have much practice with it, please desconsider any problem with the code quality or conventions. thanks
